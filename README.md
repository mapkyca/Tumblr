# Tumblr
Known plugin to syndicate your content in Known to Tumblr

Installation
------------

* Drop the Tumblr folder into the IdnoPlugins folder of your Known installation.
* Log into Known and click **Site Configuration**.
* On the **Site Features** tab, click **Enable** next to Tumblr. A **Tumblr**
entry is added to the site configuration menu.
* Click **Tumblr** in the site configuration menu. Set up your custom Tumblr
application, which will create the Tumblr posts on behalf of your Known instance, and save the API
key and API secret.

Once you have installed and configured the Tumblr plugin, each user of your
Known instance will be able to set up Tumblr syndication support using the
**Tumblr** entry in the user settings menu.
